Docker is needed for this program to run.
If running this for the first time let it compile, then you'll need to close it down and compile it again.
Open Docker and run your database.
Then in the IDE, in the Terminal window enter: docker-compose up --build and hit enter.
You should then be able to view the webpage at URL: http://localhost:3000/
